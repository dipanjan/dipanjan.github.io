I am a Ph.D. student in the SecLab (Computer Security Lab), UC Santa Barbara, advised by professor Giovanni Vigna and Christopher Kruegel.
Before that, I spent two beautiful years in IIT Madras while pursuing my M.Tech under the research guidance of professor Chandrasekaran PanduRangan.
As part of my Ph.D. research, I am excited to explore different aspects of cryptoeconomics, with an emphasis on the security of blockchain and smart contract.
Beyond that, I have a strong passion to develop automated vulnerability analysis techniques for low-level systems, e.g., operating system kernel, IoT devices, and Android.
